# Card Games

This project is a series of card games created in C#. Mainly created as an exercise to help improve my C# skills, but 
also a fun way to practice with game programming.

Currently, only Blackjack is available to play. I plan to include other card games in the future, with Texas Hold 'em
and Video Poker being some of the big ones I want to add.

## To Run

To run, simply clone the git repository and open the solution in an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio, Rider, etc.). 
Then select the relevant "card game" project you'd like to play as the startup project and run it (F5 in VS, ^R in Rider)
